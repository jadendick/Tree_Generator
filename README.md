# Tree Generator

Trees are generated using several parameters and random values. Changing window size or clicking the "Grow" button both create a new tree using the current values entered.

## Tree Parameters
**Density:** Changes how likely a branch is to form, 100 means branches are always grown.

**Angle Range:** Range for angle that branch grows from the parent at.

**Max New Branches:** Max child branches a parent can have.

**Max Branch Length:** Max length a branch can grow, trunk is always this length.

**Max Height:** Longest chain of branches allowed, trunk is height 0.

**Min Height:** Guarantees branches up to a height, prevents growing tiny trees.
